'''en_core_web_sm is the small version of the English model,
designed for basic NLP tasks such as tokenization, POS tagging, and dependency parsing.'''


'''en_core_web_md is the medium-sized version of the English model, 
designed for more advanced NLP tasks such as named entity recognition and text classification. 
This model includes more data and larger neural network models than the small version, 
and therefore provides more accurate results for these more complex tasks.'''
